The project is build with Django. The Database is the ~Sqlite3 which comes in built with the Django Framework,since the amount of data we are dealing with is very small so no external database is implemented.  

It uses GSAP for animations.

Tailwind CSS is used for the styles.

## Comments
>
 I had a great experience in building the website from designing to actually implementing the code.
 The idea was to first build the website with REACTjs or Svelte Kit but both of them required the setting 
 up of a database [either monogDB or MySQL], but django provided an inbuild database i.e. sqlite3 which made it so much easier to go for Django...<br/>

 The design started with the Homepage hero section, and other parts were designed as the project progressed. It is my first Python project where I have incorporated npm for installing JS library...<br/>

 Each section of the Homepage took one day each to complete with the hero section taking the most,more than 5 days. The other pages after completing the homepage were finished very fast one day per page. The whole project was completed in 1 month time...<br/>

 There were moments where the code had no mistakes but it refused to run. At moments I gave up and thought to give up. But something inside me made me continue, and I didn't let myself break. At last I can say that hard work has really paid off as it has turned out better than I imagined.

```Fun Fact``` During the creation of this website I had to continuously refer to the original website www.badanbarman.in for various purpose. Now the thing is that the original website contained a counter that counted how many times the website has been viewed by someone. I visited the website so many times during 1 month that the counter increased by more than 8000+ times...<br/>
