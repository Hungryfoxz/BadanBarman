The project is build with Django. The Database is the ~Sqlite3 which comes in built with the Django Framework,since the amount of data we are dealing with is very small so no external database is implemented.  

It uses GSAP for animations.

Tailwind CSS is used for the styles.

## Comments

 Building this website was a rewarding journey from concept to code. Initially, ReactJS or SvelteKit were considered, but both necessitated setting up a database like MongoDB or MySQL. Django's built-in SQLite3 database significantly simplified the development process, making it the preferred choice...<br/>

 The design started with the Homepage hero section, and other parts were designed as the project progressed. It is my first Python project where I have incorporated npm for installing JS libraries...<br/>

 The homepage hero section was the most time-consuming, requiring over five days to perfect. Other homepage sections were completed within a day each, while subsequent pages were finished rapidly, averaging one day per page. The entire project was successfully concluded within a month....<br/>

 There were countless instances where my code seemed flawless, yet refused to execute. Frustration mounted, and there were moments when giving up felt like the only option. However, an inner drive propelled me forward, refusing to yield to defeat. Ultimately, perseverance triumphed, and the final product exceeded my expectations, proving that hard work truly pays off.

 ```Fun Fact``` While building my website, I became well-acquainted with www.badanbarman.in. Perhaps a little too well-acquainted, as my frequent visits seem to have inflated the visitor counter by over 8,000! Let's just say I have single-handedly boosted the traffic stats....<br/>
